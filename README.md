- Hey I'm shaolin_peanut, a small but mighty chad, gaining in strength everyday.
  - Coming for you soon
- 👀 I have a gazillion interests, otherwise known as ADHD. Biggest interests now:
  - Holistic health (mitochondrial metabolism, autophagy, circadian biology, etc)
  - Hacking the learning process. How do our brains learn best? I could research, but for now I'd rather experiment, trying to learn hard things and playing around with psychology, notetaking mediums (excalidraw...), structures for information (graph-based like obsidian, vs folders...), and p2p learning (school 42).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning strict C programming in school 42, badge below shows where I'm at
