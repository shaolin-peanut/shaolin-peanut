- I'm a 42 Lausanne student. I finished the common core of the cursus, and am doing specialisations in math, functional programming, and a little bit of low-level things.
- working on right now
	- [matcha](https://github.com/jreivilo/matcha). react web app. I'm handling the frontend and notifications + chat
	- [ready set boole](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/readysetboole) a project to discover boolean algebra and set theory, with a functional language. I chose ocaml. Many links on that page.
 	- reviewing high school math with mathacademy.com. Transcripts available on request
- Done
	- 42's common core. Lots of projects in C, a few in C++, one webapp as a group project.
 	- 6 month internship where I discovered databases, SQL on timeseries to make graphs in grafana, webdev projects in svelte, working with data/DBs/APIs in python, etc
  	- [nm](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/) to discover the structure of elf files, what symbols are for and then display them. You have to emulate the nm cli command (linux)
  	- [linear regression](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/ft_linear_regression), a simple linear regression
  	- [dslr](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/simple_softmax_dslr/). Small machine learning project, where you have to implement a softmax regression.
  	- [libasm](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/libasm). mini project to learn assembler
