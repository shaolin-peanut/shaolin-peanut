- Welcome to my Github. I love the sun, technology, and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing the common core (equivalent to a bachelor) of 42 Lausanne, a practice-based/p2p-learning only coding school. Most of my repositories are school projects, as they didn't leave me time for much else.
  - [![sbars's 42 stats](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cl1yzv2a0004009ktxup1wxxg/stats?cursusId=21&coalitionId=193)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
- Things that I'm interested in, which are related to technology in some way
  - Tools for thought, like Obsidian, Logseq, Roam, etc. I'm not a Notion fan. Basically creating new mediums to expand possibilities for individual and collective thought, sense-making, decentralized research, etc. It's not about the tool but about the system you create by using and configuring the tool(s).
  - Infrastructure for self-sovereign and interoperable web (what early internet founders and web 3 were trying to do, not what it is now). http://worrydream.com/refs/ is a great archive for literature around that
  - Open source hardware
  - AI to use energy better (Gunter Pauli is doing interesting work in that direction).
  - regenerative agriculture, mycology, apiculture, etc. Interested in any kind of tech that can support it, maybe tiny surface/below-surface drones that can scan soil and, using AI, make a really good asessment of soil health/needs.
  - Quantum computing looks cool
  - Materials science (aka finding better materials) and tinkering to re-create tech with those, to stop the pollution from rare metals extraction
- My CS education
  - Introduction. I learned C, now I also want to introduce myself to functional programming
    - [x] 42 Piscine and first projects
    - [ ] SICP
  - Algorithms
    - [x] ft_pushswap @ 42
    - [ ] still deciding what material to add here, there are options
  - Computer Architecture
    - [ ] [nand2tetris](nand2tetris.org)
    - [ ] CMU 15-213: Intro to Computer Systems
    - [ ] or/and [this](https://cs61c.org/fa23/)
  - Operating Systems
    - [ ] probably OSTEP (Operating Systems in Three Easy Pieces)
  - Databases
    - [CMU 15-445: Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/). Lectures are on Youtube for previous years
    - [CMU 15-721: Advanced Database Systems](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2024/) same teacher
  - Networking
    - [x] [ft_irc](https://github.com/ldominiq/ft_irc)
    - [ ] [15-441/641 Computer Networks](https://computer-networks.github.io/sp19/lectures.html), would be nice if I can find lectures but pdfs and readings are pretty good already
    - [ ] Unix Network Programming for more (won't do it all, just nitpicking)
  - Advanced
