- Welcome to my Github. I love the sun, technology, and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing the common core (equivalent to a bachelor) of 42 Lausanne, a practice-based/p2p-learning only coding school. Most of my repositories are school projects, as they didn't leave me time for much else.
  - [![sbars's 42 stats](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cl1yzv2a0004009ktxup1wxxg/stats?cursusId=21&coalitionId=193)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
  - I started by learning C, which is about 2/3rds of the common core and took me a year and a half, with projects ranging from writing a standard, doing a fractals visualizer, and even coding my own shell. Here are some notable ones.
    - [Minishell](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/Minishell). Group project done with [Gabriel]([url](https://github.com/funkyhipy)). I did most of the parsing, and it taught me a lot about complex parsing operations, it's actually the first step in compiler design (but I never did code generation, maybe oneday).
    - [Fractol]([url](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/fract-ol)), the fractals explorer done with a (very) minimalist graphics library, and I wasn't allowed to use custom types to handle complex numbers, which made the math a little more tricky (not my strong suit but I want to learn more math).
    - [Philosophers](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/philosophers), a logic exercise to solve with multithreading and mutexes. My solution is not the most efficient one (I have one 'death_monitor' thread for each philosopher, could have been for all of them, but with changes to the whole thing), but I discovered the power of multithreading and the challenges it presents.
    - Libft (uploading soon), a standard library that taught me how to code in C, basically. Fundamentals (loops, variables, lots of pointers), char by char parsing and memory allocation (on stack and heap), data types, how to write good and clear functions, etc.
  - Then I had a brief (2-3 months) period to discover CPP, first with another piscine (series of modules, each containing 3-5 exercises, to learn a language), and then with a web project.
    - I'm quite proud of the work I did with [Lucas Dominiq](url), to code a functional [IRC server](https://github.com/ldominiq/ft_irc). That first project in a higher-abstraction language got us developing end-user features quickly (private msgs, channels, operators, protocol-compliance), which was a lot of fun.
    - I haven't uploaded the piscine yet as the code is not exceptional (might do it later)
  - There were also projects which taught us other tools: **Virtual Machines** and container orchestration with **Docker**
    - Born2BeRoot was a project where we had to fully configure a safe virtual machine, with passwords policies, broadcast messages to all users, etc.
    - [Inception](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/Inception) asks us to do, in a virtual machine, using docker-compose, the container orchestration needed to run a wordpress website.
      - Seems easy, but we couldn't just use the wordpress image from DockerHub. Only image allowed to be used was Debian, so everything had to be installed and configured on the container. Also, the mariadb database and nginx server (reverse proxy setup), each have to be in a separate container (which requires proper network and port-forwarding/mapping setup).
- Things that I'm interested in, which are related to technology in some way
  - Tools for thought, like Obsidian, Logseq, Roam, etc. I'm not a Notion fan. Basically creating new mediums to expand possibilities for individual and collective thought, sense-making, decentralized research, etc. It's not about the tool but about the system you create by using and configuring the tool(s).
  - Infrastructure for self-sovereign and interoperable web (what early internet founders and web 3 were trying to do, not what it is now). http://worrydream.com/refs/ is a great archive for literature around that
  - Open source hardware
  - AI to use energy better (Gunter Pauli is doing interesting work in that direction).
  - regenerative agriculture, mycology, apiculture, etc. Interested in any kind of tech that can support it, maybe tiny surface/below-surface drones that can scan soil and, using AI, make a really good asessment of soil health/needs.
  - Quantum computing looks cool
  - Materials science (aka finding better materials) and tinkering to re-create tech with those, to stop the pollution from rare metals extraction
