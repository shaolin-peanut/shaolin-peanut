- I'm a 42 Lausanne student. I finished the common core of the cursus, and am doing specialisations in math, functional programming, and a little bit of low-level things.
- Projects (todo: fill that in)
	- Low level
 	- Data Science
  	- Functional Programming, Math
- I have 3 big goals for this chapter of my life.
	1. Review high school math and work my way up to graduate math for fun and for coding
	2. Understand computers on many layers, from logic gates to cpu architecture systems and network protocols
	3. Fill the gaps in fundamental cs things. More algos and data structures
- working on right now
	- [matcha](https://github.com/jreivilo/matcha). react web app, part of the OOP projects for 42's RNCP 6, and Database branch for RNCP 7
	- [ready set boole](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/readysetboole) a project to discover boolean algebra and set theory, with a functional language. I chose ocaml. Many links on that page.
 	- high school math with mathacademy.com. Transcripts available on request
- to do next
	- hypertube, group project. Streaming video with torrents as the source, with a bunch of features (search, thumbnails, auth, comments, etc).
	- ft_turing. More functional programming in ocaml. Modeling a turing machine
	- computorv1. parsing/evaluating/analyzing polynomial expression
	- matrix. linear algebra
- done
	- 42's common core. Lots of projects in C, a few in C++, one webapp as a group project.
 	- 6 month internship where I discovered databases, SQL on timeseries to make graphs in grafana, webdev projects in svelte, working with data/DBs/APIs in python, etc
  	- [nm](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/) to discover the structure of elf files, what symbols are for and then display them. You have to emulate the nm cli command (linux)
  	- [dslr](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/simple_softmax_dslr/). Small machine learning project, where you have to implement a softmax regression.
  	- [libasm](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/libasm). mini project to learn assembler
