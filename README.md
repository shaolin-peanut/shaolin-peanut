- I'm a 42 Lausanne student. I finished the common core of the cursus, and am doing specialisations in math, functional programming, and low-level things.
	- C/C++ projects. Systems programming mostly, some computer graphics
        - [ft_nm](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/) to discover the structure of elf files, what symbols are for and then display them. You have to emulate the nm cli command (linux)
        - [julia and mandelbrot fractals explorer](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/fract-ol)
        - [libasm](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/libasm). mini project to learn the basics of Intel 64 assembly
       	- [Minishell](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/Minishell). Writing a subset of bash's features. One of my favorite 42 projects
        - [philosophers](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/philosophers). Solving the dining philosophers problem with posix pthreads
        - [pushswap](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/42_push_swap) Sorting numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations, with radix sort
        - [pipex](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/pipex) re-creating the cli command that does pipe redirection  
   	- Python/Data-Science
	   	- Small contributions at Hackatons:
	   	- [Pro ML Training](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/pro-ml-training). 3-day training hosted at 42 Lausanne, where I explored linear regression on different datasets and varying methods (with scikit-learn, or rolling it out by hand without even pandas, only numpy), and some data processing/feature-engineering/EDA with Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
	   	- [linear regression](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/ft_linear_regression), a simple linear regression
	  	- [dslr](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/simple_softmax_dslr/). Small machine learning project, where you have to implement a softmax regression (logistic regression but classifying in more than two classes, so sigmoid doesn't cut it)
	- Web Development
	     - [matcha](https://github.com/jreivilo/matcha). Dating app in React. Includes chat with matches, notifications over websockets, filterable/sortable explore page, editing your profile, uploading up to 5 profile pictures, and more interactions (like, block, report etc). I'm handling frontend and websockets
	     - Two web apps during my internship, in Sveltekit (typescript)
	     - [transcendence](https://github.com/eprei/42_ft_transcendence) group project. I did oauth2 and leaderboard
	- System Administration
        - [inception](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/Inception). An introduction to docker by setting a wordpress install with nginx and mariadb via docker-compose
        - did a bunch of scripts to plug into databases, apis etc to move data around during my internship. I don't own the code though, no longer have it
	   	- Born2BeRoot. Virtual machine setup, no repo because there was barely any code, just thorough VM setup (password policies, users, and a cron job running a script printing system info)
	- Extra topics
		- [ready set boole](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/readysetboole) a project to discover boolean algebra and set theory, with a functional language. I chose ocaml. Many links on that page.
	 	- reviewing high school math with mathacademy.com. Transcripts available on request
