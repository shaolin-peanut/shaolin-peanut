- Hey I'm shaolin_peanut. I love the sun, technology, and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning strict C programming in school 42, badge below shows where I'm at. I've published some of the projects I've done at school on here, when the code was worth sharing publicly.
  - [![sbars's 42 stats](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cl1yzv2a0004009ktxup1wxxg/stats?cursusId=21&coalitionId=193)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)
  - I intend to write more documentation to explain my projects, and notions I acquired by completing them.
- I'm too busy with 42 to do my own projects yet, but... If you're interested in some of the subjects below, reaach out!
  - Tools for thought, like Obsidian, Logseq, Roam, etc. I'm not a Notion fan. Basically creating new mediums to expand possibilities for individual and collective thought, sense-making, decentralized research, etc
  - Infrastructure for self-sovereign and interoperable web (what early internet founders and web 3 was trying to do, not what it is now). http://worrydream.com/refs/ is a great archive for literature around that
  - Open source hardware
  - AI for ecology (like modelling complex systems)
  - And other things I don't remember all my interests, will add when I do
