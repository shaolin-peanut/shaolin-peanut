- I'm a 42 Lausanne student. I finished the core and am doing specialisations, in math, functional programming, and a little bit of low-level things.
- I have 3 big goals for this chapter of my life.
	1. Learn math from the ground up, up to advanced applied topics.
	2. Understand computers on many layers, as well as I can, from logic gates to operating systems and network protocols
	3. Fill all the gaps in my CS education to become a really good dev. For example there's still many data structures I don't know (trees, hash maps, etc), algorithms I'm unaware of and concepts I just don't get (like algorithm complexity).
- To reach those goals I'm doing multiple projects and using external ressources
	- [ ] finalize the "map" and embed here
- currently I'm working on
	- hypertube, group project. Streaming video with torrents as the source, with a bunch of features (search, thumbnails, auth, comments, etc).
	- [ready set boole](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/readysetboole) a project to discover boolean algebra and set theory, with a functional language. I chose ocaml. Many links on that page.
 	- Working through all of the AOPS books
  	- CMU 15-150 Introduction to Functional Programming. [lectures here](https://brandonspark.github.io/150/)
  	- libasm. mini project to learn assembler
- to do next
	- ft_turing. More functional programming in ocaml. Modeling a turing machine
	- malloc. recoding malloc to learn about memory management, mmap etc
	- computorv1. parsing/evaluating/analyzing polynomial expression
	- matrix. linear algebra	
	- ft_linux. Compile your linux distribution. Need to setup well and then have a long day uninterrupted to compile, and I doubt my archaic computer will survive it. This project opens up a branch of many projects in kernel dev / related stuff
	- then we'll see, not sure yet
- done
	- 42's common core. Lots of projects in C, a few in C++, one webapp as a group project.
 	- 6 month internship where I discovered databases, SQL on timeseries to make graphs in grafana, webdev projects in svelte, working with data/DBs/APIs in python, etc
  	- [nm](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/) to discover the structure of elf files, what symbols are for and then display them. You have to emulate the nm cli command (linux)
  	- [dslr](https://github.com/shaolin-peanut/simple_softmax_dslr/). Small machine learning project, where you have to implement a softmax regression.
